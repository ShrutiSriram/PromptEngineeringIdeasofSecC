You are an UI/UX designer working for a tech company which is launching a new educational app for children. The application is called 'mcqMind' which helps with children to practice questions for revision purposes. The way this application works is that children upload pics or pdfs of chapters or specific pages and an AI model generates questions in their preferred format (eg- Mcqs, short answer questions, long answer questions, etc.) This is compatible for kids of grades 1- 12 and caters to all school boards- CBSE, ICSE, IGCSE, State board, IB, etc. It mainly focuses on revising questions for the students and not "teaching them" for now. It gives the right answer after the student attempts the questions and gives overall score too. It keeps a record of progress which can be accessed in their "records" tab. The colour scheme for this app is mainly white with night blue, mint green and yellow ochre accents. Red and green for right and wrong resp. in the records tab. The app should potray a simle UI so that even younger chilldren are able to navigate throught it easily. Generate UI images (3-4 screens) on an Iphone 15 screen mockup of how the app's UI can look
